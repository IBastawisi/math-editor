        This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are
        concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is
        being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information
        security, is information that can be used on its own or with other
        information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to
        identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy
        carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect
        or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in
        accordance with our website.

        personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted
        third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our
        business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep
        this information confidential. We may also release your information when
        we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our
        site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.
